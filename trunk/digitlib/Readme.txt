DigitLib: Digital Library System
================================


Digitlib is a web-based open source  software for building a digital library.
This system manages digital library data in the RDF model.
This system is implimented in Java.
You can use various RDBMS (i.e. mysql, postgressql, oracle, etc) as RDF repositories.

It provides: 


A search service with preferences option 
A maintenace service (registration, modification, unregistration)
A notification service  
The registration and research services can be carried out according to a taxonomy. 

DigitLIB is implimented in Netbeans IDE (Netbeans.org)

For more information, visit digitLib home page http://digitlib.sourceforge.net/


For installation instructions, go and read INSTALL file, also remember
to read CREDITS file to know from where comes the things. 

Please, enjoy DigitLib and remember that this is free GPL software and
comes without any warranty and without technical support, so please don't
email me asking how to make this or that, I'll ignore that type of emails.

DigitLib isn't perfect, but your suggestions and feedback can help all
us to have a very well done digital library system!
